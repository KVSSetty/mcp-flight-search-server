# MCP Flight Search
A flight search service built with Model Context Protocol (MCP). This service demonstrates how to implement MCP tools for flight search capabilities.

## What is Model Context Protocol?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI models to use tools by defining a structured format for tool descriptions, calls, and responses. This project implements MCP tools that can be used by Claude and other MCP-compatible models.
